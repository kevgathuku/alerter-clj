Coming to the Chrome Web Store soon.<p>Would love feedback on the onboarding experience and general UX – there were a lot of design decisions I wasn't sure about.<p>Happy to answer questions about the implementation.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46490895\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46490895</a></p>\n<p>Points: 13</p>\n<p># Comments: 6</p>\n"}, :excerpts [{:text "... on any webpage: documentation sites, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.<p>How it works:\n- When a code block comes...", :matched-terms ["gpt" "claude"], :source :content} {:text "... detects tokens and sends the code to an LLM (via OpenRouter or custom endpoint)\n- The LLM generates documentation for tokens worth...", :matched-terms ["llm"], :source :content}]} {:rule-id "rails-testing", :item {:feed-id "hn-frontpage", :item-id "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46492063", :title "Eurostar AI vulnerability: when a chatbot goes off the rails", :link "https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/eurostar-ai-vulnerability-when-a-chatbot-goes-off-the-rails/", :published-at #inst "2026-01-04T20:52:52.000-00:00", :content "\n<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/eurostar-ai-vulnerability-when-a-chatbot-goes-off-the-rails/\">https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/eurostar-ai-vulnerability-when-a-chatbot-goes-off-the-rails/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46492063\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46492063</a></p>\n<p>Points: 21</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>\n"}, :excerpts [{:text "...
