Or worse - I'd ask the agent to run them and it would start looping: fix tests, those fail, then it starts \"fixing\" my code so tests pass, or just deletes assertions so they \"pass\".<p>Out of that frustration I built KeelTest - a VS Code extension that generates pytest tests and executes them, got hooked and decided to push this project forward... When tests fail, it tries to figure out why:<p>- Generation error: Attemps to fix it automatically, then tries again<p>- Bug in your source code: flags it and explains what's wrong<p>How it works:<p>- Static analysis to map dependencies, patterns, services to mock.<p>- Generate a plan for each function and what edge cases to cover<p>- Generate those tests<p>- Execute in \"sandbox\"<p>- Self-heal failures or flag source bugs<p>Python + pytest only for now. Alpha stage - not all codebases work reliably. But testing on personal projects and a few production apps at work, it's been consistently decent. Works best on simpler applications, sometimes glitches on monorepos setups. Supports Poetry/UV/plain pip setups.<p>Install from VS Code marketplace: <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KeelCode.keeltest\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KeelCode...</a><p>More detailed writeup how it works: <a href=\"https://keelcode.dev/blog/introducing-keeltest\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://keelcode.dev/blog/introducing-keeltest</a><p>Free tier is 7 tests files/month (current limit is <=300 source LOC).
