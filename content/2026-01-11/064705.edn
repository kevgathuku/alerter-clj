Enter your idea, pick a genre and length, and you get:\nFull manuscript PDF (formatted for print with title page, copyright, chapters)\nEditable DOCX file\nAI-generated cover art\nPrint-ready cover PDF with spine\nThe whole thing takes a few minutes. Output is sized for standard trim sizes so you can upload directly to KDP or other print-on-demand services. Built with Claude for the writing and image generation for covers. Priced starting at $19. Would love feedback on the concept and output quality. <a href=\"https://printreadybook.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://printreadybook.com</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46572593\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46572593</a></p>\n<p>Points: 8</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>\n"}, :excerpts [{:text "... or other print-on-demand services.
