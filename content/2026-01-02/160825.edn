It's probably of no use, but reposted for posterity!</em></p>\n<p>Over the years, I've tried <em>lots</em> of text editors. Vim, EMACS, Sublime Text,\nJedit, Nano, Notepad++ (and more). As I use Linux at home and Windows at work, I've been looking for a while, for one that I can use on either OS. </p>\n<p>As much as I love Linux (and I have <strong>no</strong> desire to switch back to Windows after about six years), there is some software written for Windows that I think is fantastic. Foobar2000, imgburn (when I used to burn discs), Adobe Photoshop and namexif spring to mind. </p>\n<p>So, a few weeks ago I set about (again) finding a text editor that I could use just as well at work as I could at home. I had another go with Notepad++. It seemed to be trying to do a bit too much. The interface has too much going on. I needed something simpler. Plus there were some oddities running on Wine. I somehow stumbled upon Notepad2-mod <a href=\"https://xhmikosr.github.io/notepad2-mod/\">https://xhmikosr.github.io/notepad2-mod/</a>. </p>\n<p>A text editor that wanted to be <em>slightly better</em> than Notepad??? This doesn't sound good, I thought. But when I tried it, it seemed to be just what I was looking for. Syntax highlighting for Python and indentation guides are all I really need at the moment. Plus, it works great on Wine. </p>\n<p>It does very little for you, except what you <strong>need</strong>. I class that as a\nfeature. I have the utmost respect for editors like Vim, but that it is pretty\nmuch unusable \"out of the box\", without hunting around on the net for \ntips on how to set up your <code>.vimrc</code> seems strange to me. </p>\n<p>If you haven't tried it, and are wanting to do some coding, rather than\nlearning the intricacies of a particular text editor, I urge you to give it\na go. </p>", :categories ({:name "software", :taxonomy-url nil} {:name "coding", :taxonomy-url nil} {:name "archived", :taxonomy-url nil})}, :excerpts [{:text "My New Favourite Text Editor", :matched-terms ["editor"], :source :title} {:text "... the years, I've tried <em>lots</em> of text editors.

I&#8217;ve used xed for most of the <a href=\"https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/\">bottle.py</a> programs I&#8217;ve written. I never really thought about it, just used it as it got the job done. I generally use Nano for editing files over <span class=\"caps\">SSH</span> and have also used that for many years.</p>\n\n\t<p>A few weeks ago, I was thinking about my workflow and wondered why I wasn&#8217;t using a terminal based editor? Here&#8217;s how I use bottle.py</p>\n\n\t<p>1. Fire up <a href=\"https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki\">tmux</a><br />\n2. Run &#8220;python3 name-of-program.py&#8220;<br />\n3. Open another tmux window for <a href=\"https://www.mercurial-scm.org/\">Mercurial</a> checkins</p>\n\n\t<p>Here&#8217;s a screenshot of my terminal whilst writing this post:</p>\n\n\t<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/img/2025-09-13/terminal.webp\" /></p>\n\n\t<p>It started bothering me that I was faffing about having to use my mouse to navigate between the terminal and my text editor. So I decided to find a terminal (non <span class=\"caps\">GUI</span>) editor that would suit me. </p>\n\n\t<h2>My Editor Requirements</h2>\n\n\t<p>I was well aware of the <strong>hundreds</strong> of editors available for Linux, having had a play with most of them at one time or another:</p>\n\n\t<p>Emacs, Vim, Jed, Vile, Jove, Joe, Nano, mg, etc&#8230;.</p>\n\n\t<p>So I had a think about what was vital and what would be nice-to-have features.</p>\n\n\t<h3>Vital</h3>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Multiple buffers</strong> &#8212; I usually have at least two source code files open at a time when I&#8217;m coding.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Good support for keyboard shortcuts</strong> &#8212; Of course, this is subjective. Emacs and Vim let you do anything, but I don&#8217;t normally need that much power! However, most things that I may need to do on a daily basis should have a shortcut.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Remapping of keys</strong> &#8212; I&#8217;ve used <a href=\"https://colemak.com/\">Colemak</a> since about 2008, so what might be great for <span class=\"caps\">QWERTY</span>, may not be great for me.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Quickly delete lines</strong> &#8212; One of the features I really liked with Vim is <code>dd</code> to delete a line, followed by <code>.</code> to delete subsequent lines.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\n\t<h3>Nice to Have&#8217;s</h3>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Sensible Defaults</strong> &#8212; This is one of the things I&#8217;ve always liked about Nano. You can just start using it. Shortcuts are visible at the bottom of the window if you need them.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Show a line at 80 columns</strong> &#8212; I don&#8217;t like long lines of code.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Quickly comment / uncomment code</strong> &#8212; I got very used to xed&#8217;s <code>Ctrl-/</code> for this purpose!</li>\n\t</ul>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Auto ident</strong> &#8212; I use Python more than any other language, so auto indenting is hard to live without.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Syntax Highlighting</strong> &#8212; Not 100% critical, but is often useful for seeing what&#8217;s what.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Bookmarks</strong> &#8212; Very useful to be able to mark lines in files and jump between them.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Scroll without moving cursor</strong> &#8212; I liked this feature I first saw in Vim. You move the screen but the cursor stays where it is</li>\n\t</ul>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Insert a newline above / below current line</strong> &#8212; Some editors have a shortcut that will insert a newline without having to go to the end of the line, press enter</li>\n\t</ul>\n\n\t<h2>Where I Looked Closer at Nano</h2>\n\n\t<p>I won&#8217;t lie, Nano came first to mind. I was already familiar with it and it seems to be installed everywhere I need it. But did it do what I needed (and would like it to do)?</p>\n\n\t<p>Yes, it would (I found out after an hour or so)!</p>\n\n\t<p>I discovered pretty quickly that version 8, released in 2024 had introduced &#8220;modern bindings&#8221;:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p><em>Command-line option  -- modernbindings (-/) makes ^Q quit, ^X cut, ^C copy, ^V paste, ^Z undo, ^Y redo, ^O open a file, ^W write a file, ^R replace, ^G find again, ^D find again backwards, ^A set the mark, ^T jump to a line, ^P show the position, and ^E execute.</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\t<p>I look at that as a sensible default. The original shortcuts aren&#8217;t terrible, but I like the <span class=\"caps\">CUA</span> ones more. So I downloaded the latest tarball (8.6) and compiled it. I added <code>alias nano=\"nano -/\"</code> to my <code>.bashrc</code> (and on all my servers). </p>\n\n\t<h2>What I Needed / Wanted</h2>\n\n\t<p>&check; multiple buffers: <code>set multibuffer</code><br />\n&check; comment / uncomment code: <code>Alt-3</code><br />\n&check; show end of line: <code>set guidestripe 80</code><br />\n&check; syntax highlighting: <code>include /usr/local/share/nano/*.nanorc</code><br />\n&check; quickly delete lines:<br />\n<code>Alt-delete</code> to delete entire line<br />\n<code>Alt-backspace</code> to  delete words<br />\n&check; bookmarks: &#8220;anchors&#8221; in Nano speak.<br />\n<code>Alt-Insert</code> to set/unset.<br />\n<code>Alt-PgUp</code> / <code>Alt-PgDn</code> to cycle through them<br />\n&check; move viewport up and down: <code>Alt--</code> / <code>Alt-+</code><br />\n&check; insert a newline above / below current line<br />\n<code>bind ^N \"{home}{enter}{up}\" main</code> <br />\n<code>bind ^k \"{end}{enter}\" main</code></p>\n\n\t<h2>My Tweaks</h2>\n\n\t<p>Many, many years ago,<sup class=\"footnote\" id=\"fnrev5e7074a98f254b8aada5d36a4c653de9-1\"><a href=\"#fn5e7074a98f254b8aada5d36a4c653de9-1\">1</a></sup> I came across the idea of having the arrow keys accessible on the home row using either the <code>CTRL</code> or <code>ALT</code> keys. Similar to this keyboard:</p>\n\n\t<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/img/2025-09-13/arrow_keys.png\" /></p>\n\n\t<p>As I was hoping to somewhat optimize my text editing, I figured I&#8217;d try and get some often used keys where I wanted them.<sup class=\"footnote\" id=\"fnrev5e7074a98f254b8aada5d36a4c653de9-2\"><a href=\"#fn5e7074a98f254b8aada5d36a4c653de9-2\">2</a></sup> Using <span class=\"caps\">QWERTY</span> notation, I now have:</p>\n\n\t<p><code>Alt-j</code> &#8212; Left<br />\n<code>Alt-k</code> &#8212; Down<br />\n<code>Alt-i</code> &#8212; Up<br />\n<code>Alt-l</code> &#8212; Right<br />\n<code>Alt-u</code> &#8212; Home<br />\n<code>Alt-o</code> &#8212; End<br />\n<code>Alt-h</code> &#8212; Delete<br />\n<code>Ctrl-k</code> &#8212; Page Down<br />\n<code>Ctrl-i</code> &#8212; Page Up</p>\n\n\t<p>Very nice! I&#8217;m already used to them after only a few days. If you&#8217;re interested, below is my <code>.nanorc</code></p>\n\n\t<h2>My .nanorc</h2>\n\n<pre><code># $Id: .nanorc,v 1.6 2025/09/15 13:29:21 simon Exp simon $\n\nset multibuffer\nset tabsize 4\nset tabstospaces\nset autoindent\nset wordbounds\nset quickblank\nset trimblanks\nset linenumbers\nset smarthome\nset mouse\nset indicator\nset guidestripe 80\nset positionlog\nset quickblank\nset stateflags\n\nset brackets &quot;&quot;&#39;)&gt;]}&quot;\nset matchbrackets &quot;(&lt;[{)&gt;]}&quot;\n\nset keycolor cyan\nset functioncolor cyan\nset numbercolor yellow\n\nbind M-5 cycle main\n\n#=============================================\n# Experimental: bring useful keys to home row\n#=============================================\n\nbind M-n left main\nbind M-i right main\nbind M-u up main\nbind M-e down main\nbind M-l home main\nbind M-y end main\nbind M-h delete main\n\nbind ^u pageup main\nbind ^e pagedown main\n\n# newline above current line\nbind ^n &quot;{home}{enter}{up}&quot; main\n\n# newline below current line\nbind ^k &quot;{end}{enter}&quot; main\n\ninclude /usr/local/share/nano/*.nanorc\ninclude &quot;~/.nano/tpl.nanorc&quot;</code></pre>\n\n\t<h2>Why Not Just Use&#8230;</h2>\n\n\t<p>Of course, anyone who comes here may have their own, possibly strong, opinions about which text editor is <em>the one true editor</em>. Fair enough, but I can&#8217;t be bothered to spend weeks learning how to use a text editor. </p>\n\n\t<p>I set out to find a <span class=\"caps\">TUI</span> editor to do my work with and have found it with <span class=\"caps\">GNU</span> Nano.</p>\n\n\t<p>I&#8217;ll quickly mention why some other, obvious editors didn&#8217;t beat Nano for me.</p>\n\n\t<p>1. Emacs</p>\n\n\t<p>Sorry, but having to type <code>Ctrl-X Ctrl-C</code> to exit isn&#8217;t for me.</p>\n\n\t<p>2. Vim</p>\n\n\t<p>Philosophically, I like the idea of a modal editor. However, in practice, I&#8217;ve always found Vim&#8217;s learning curve not worth the time. If I wrote software for a living, instead of as a hobby, I might invest more time in learning it. Maybe&#8230;</p>\n\n\t<p>3. Micro</p>\n\n\t<p>Micro does seem interesting. However, Nano with <code>--modern-bindings</code> possibly makes it less interesting.</p>\n\n\t<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\t<p>Like a lot of people, I&#8217;ve been unaware of exactly what Nano is capable of. I&#8217;ve been pressing pageup repeatedly to get to the top of the screen when I could have just pressed <code>Ctrl-home</code> or <code>Ctrl-end</code> to go to the beginning or end of the file. </p>\n\n\t<p>Likewise, I never knew that <code>Alt-home</code> and <code>Alt-end</code> would take me to the first / last lines in the viewport.</p>\n\n\t<p>Embarrassingly, I didn&#8217;t know that Nano supported multiple buffers. So like a fool, I&#8217;d edit one file on a server, close it, open another one, close that, open the first one again&#8230;</p>\n\n\t<p>Today I&#8217;ve just found that Nano supports <em>soft wrapping</em> using <code>Alt-s</code> which has proven useful writing this post in Textile where unwanted newlines are inserted.</p>\n\n\t<p>I think some people in the Linux world see Nano as our Windows Notepad. Not something to be used by serious people with serious things to do. I never thought that, but after reading the excellent documentation on the Nano website (and man / info pages) I&#8217;m now aware of exactly what it can do.</p>\n\n\t<p>I hope that you too, will have another look at this awesome little editor.</p>\n\n\t<p><a href=\"https://www.nano-editor.org/\"><img align=\"center\" alt=\"\" src=\"/img/logo/withnano.png\" /></a></p>\n\n\t<h2 class=\"footnotes\">Footnotes</h2>\n\n\t<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5e7074a98f254b8aada5d36a4c653de9-1\"><sup>1</sup> I believe it was Ergoemacs that introduced me to this idea.</p>\n\n\t<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5e7074a98f254b8aada5d36a4c653de9-2\"><sup>2</sup> If you want to do this yourself, here are a couple of tips.

Sorry, it isn&#8217;t. Furthermore, it hasn&#8217;t been designed to be better than <em>anything</em>! </p>\n\n\t<p>Microsoft explained why they created Edit on their <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/edit-is-now-open-source/\">Devblog</a>:</p>\n\n\t<blockquote>\n\t\t<p><em>What motivated us to build Edit was the need for a default  CLI  text editor in 64-bit versions of Windows. 32-bit versions of Windows ship with the  MS-DOS editor , but 64-bit versions do not have a  CLI  editor installed inbox. From there, we narrowed down our options…</em></p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\n\t<blockquote>\n\t\t<p><em>Many of you are probably familiar with the “How do I exit vim?” meme. While it is relatively simple to learn the magic exit incantation, it’s certainly not a coincidence that this often turns up as a stumbling block for new and old programmers.</em></p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\n\t<blockquote>\n\t\t<p><em>Because we wanted to avoid this for a built-in default editor, we decided that we wanted a modeless editor for Windows (versus a modal editor where new users would have to remember different modes of operation and how to switch between them).</em></p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\n\t<blockquote>\n\t\t<p><em>This unfortunately limited our choices to a list of editors that either had no first-party support for Windows or were too big to bundle them with every version of the OS. As a result, Edit was born.</em></p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\n\t<p>It should be noted that this <em>new</em>, Rust written Edit, is a modern version of an old <span class=\"caps\">DOS</span> program of the same name. Here&#8217;s what that looked like:</p>\n\n\t<p><img alt=\"DOS edit\" src=\"/img/2025-09-23/edit_dos.webp\" title=\"DOS edit\" /></p>\n\n\t<p>Edit is designed for very simple editing. Below is the <em>entire</em> man page:</p>\n\n\t<p><img alt=\"Manpage on Linux\" src=\"/img/2025-09-23/edit_manpage.webp\" title=\"Manpage on Linux\" /></p>\n\n\t<p>Nice and clear, and the program is learnable in approximately <em>5 minutes</em>. In contrast, you&#8217;ll probably need a couple of hours to fully learn and become productive with <span class=\"caps\">GNU</span> Nano. They have different histories and purposes. Here is the first paragraph from the Nano <span class=\"caps\">README</span>:</p>\n\n\t<p><img alt=\"Nano history\" src=\"/img/2025-09-23/nano_readme.webp\" title=\"Nano history\" /></p>\n\n\t<p>Nano began life as a clone of Pico<sup class=\"footnote\" id=\"fnrev052fdbcbaaa24ce0bd4c150271cc44ca-1\"><a href=\"#fn052fdbcbaaa24ce0bd4c150271cc44ca-1\">1</a></sup>, then added features that users wished Pico had, whilst retaining its simple, easy to use nature. Edit is a re-implementation of <span class=\"caps\">DOS</span> edit.com. The stated goal of Edit is</p>\n\n\t<blockquote>\n\t\t<p><em>&#8230;to provide an accessible editor that even users largely unfamiliar with terminals can easily use.</em></p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\n\t<p>You can type characters, delete them, search and replace, and that&#8217;s about it. Which is fine. Remember, this will ship with <em>Windows</em>. Now I haven&#8217;t used Windows at home since, maybe, 2006. MS Edit is not targeted at me, or anyone other than <em>their</em> customers. It&#8217;s there because they <em>should</em> have a terminal text editor. It&#8217;s not fancy or powerful but it will allow their customers to edit text files from the command line in a stress free way.</p>\n\n\t<p>Personally, I like what they&#8217;ve done. There&#8217;s no configuration and no options to muck about with. You fire it up and do what you need to do. </p>\n\n\t<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\t<p>I think Edit is a great bit of software. I like that Microsoft have released it as open source, and that they release Linux builds. I&#8217;ve had a play with it and haven&#8217;t felt the need to delete it. To my mind, it has already achieved it&#8217;s stated goal. There&#8217;s not really anything else that it needs at this point. I&#8217;m sure Microsoft are fully aware that if they start adding new features, it becomes <em>harder</em> to learn, <em>harder</em> to use. <span class=\"caps\">GNU</span> Nano doesn&#8217;t have that contraint.

Which raises the question, </p>\n\n\t<blockquote>\n\t\t<p>&#8220;will I be able to open / edit these documents in twenty years time?&#8221;</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\n\t<p>So, while wpunix is an interesting piece of software, it&#8217;s probably <strong>not</strong> the best idea to do all your writing with it. </p>\n\n\t<p>So, as I&#8217;m inclined to do, I set about seeing what other options I have for editing documents on the command line.</p>\n\n\t<h2><span class=\"caps\">JOE</span> Editor (Jstar)</h2>\n\n\t<p><img alt=\"Joe jstar mode\" src=\"/img/2025-09-27/joe-editor.webp\" title=\"Joe jstar mode\" /></p>\n\n\t<p>I was already familiar with <a href=\"https://joe-editor.sourceforge.io/\"><span class=\"caps\">JOE</span></a> and vaguely remembered that it had a Wordstar emulation mode. I&#8217;ve never used Wordstar, but know it&#8217;s still considered  irreplaceable by some <a href=\"https://sfwriter.com/wordstar.htm\">notable users</a>. So, I had a play with it but it&#8217;s not quite what I&#8217;m after. The only formatting that one could consider somewhat out of the ordinary with Jstar is being able to centre text. </p>\n\n\t<h2>What Should a Word Processor Do?</h2>\n\n\t<p>To my mind, at a minimum, a word processor should be able to:</p>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>bold, underline and italicize text</li>\n\t\t<li>Centre, left and right align text</li>\n\t\t<li>Justify text</li>\n\t\t<li>Have various types of headings</li>\n\t</ul>\n\n\t<p>I was amazed that no such command line program seemed to exist. Yeah sure, we&#8217;ve got loads of Markdown editors, but I don&#8217;t consider Markdown to be anything related to word processing. I even thought about attempting to make my own format (how hard could it be?!). But luckily, I came across:</p>\n\n\t<h2><span class=\"caps\">RFC</span> 1896 The text/enriched <span class=\"caps\">MIME</span> Content-type</h2>\n\n\t<p>For some reason, I always forget than <em>any</em> computer problem was almost certainly solved years ago. And so it was for this problem. <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1896.html\"><span class=\"caps\">RFC</span> 1896</a> was suggested in 1996 to allow formatting of email messages. Unfortunately, it never caught on. Still, it exists and is a standard and Emacs has an enriched mode! See <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Enriched-Text.html\">here</a> for online documentation. Here&#8217;s the &#8220;source&#8221; code for the screenshot at the top of this post:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Content-Type: text/enriched\nText-Width: 70\n\n&lt;flushright&gt;This is right aligned \n\n&lt;/flushright&gt;&lt;center&gt;\n\nHere is some &lt;bold&gt;bold &lt;/bold&gt;text and here is some that is &lt;italic&gt;italic&lt;/italic&gt;.\n\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;flushboth&gt;\n\nEnriched mode is a minor mode for editing formatted text files in a\nWYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) fashion. When Enriched mode is\nenabled, you can apply various formatting properties to the text in\nthe buffer, such as fonts and colors; upon saving the buffer, those\nproperties are saved together with the text, using the MIME\n‘text/enriched’ file format.\n\n\nEnriched mode is typically used with Text mode (see Text Mode). It is\nnot compatible with Font Lock mode, which is used by many major modes,\nincluding most programming language modes, for syntax highlighting\n(see Font Lock mode).  Unlike Enriched mode, Font Lock mode assigns\ntext properties automatically, based on the current buffer contents;\nthose properties are not saved to disk.\n\n&lt;/flushboth&gt;&lt;center&gt;\n\n&lt;underline&gt;Underlined Heading&lt;/underline&gt;\n\n&lt;/center&gt;</code></pre>\n\n\t<p>The only thing that seems to be missing from enriched-mode is increasing the font size. There&#8217;s a discussion on the mailing list that goes into detail:</p>\n\n\t<p><a href=\"https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2025-06/msg00146.html\">Making selected text larger in enriched mode</a> </p>\n\n\t<p>Apart from that, enriched-mode seems pretty much perfect for writing. </p>\n\n\t<h2>Using Emacs Enriched Mode</h2>\n\n\t<p>I won&#8217;t go into great detail as the documentation link above explains everything, but here are my brief notes:</p>\n\n\t<p>Type <code>M-x enriched-mode</code> on a new file to activate the mode.<sup class=\"footnote\" id=\"fnrevd21a9a1cc29f4b53baae5f1d179ba3df-1\"><a href=\"#fnd21a9a1cc29f4b53baae5f1d179ba3df-1\">1</a></sup> Then, you only really <em>need</em> to remember two shortcuts:</p>\n\n\t<p><code>Alt-o</code> to bring up the <em>Options(?)</em> menu and <code>Alt-j</code> to bring up the <em>Justify</em> menu.</p>\n\n\t<p>Then, you can just press a single letter:</p>\n\n\t<p><img alt=\"Emacs enriched mode options menu\" src=\"/img/2025-09-27/alt-o.png\" title=\"Emacs enriched mode options menu\" /></p>\n\n\t<p><code>Alt-o</code> <code>b</code> to bold for example</p>\n\n\t<p><img alt=\"Emacs enriched mode justification menu\" src=\"/img/2025-09-27/alt-j.png\" title=\"Emacs enriched mode justification menu\" /></p>\n\n\t<p><code>Alt-j</code> <code>b</code> to justify </p>\n\n\t<h2>Plain Text Benefits</h2>\n\n\t<p>As enriched text is simply plain text with a bit of markup, it&#8217;s easily versionable (<span class=\"caps\">RCS</span>, Mercurial / Git et al.). You can write a script to convert your enriched text to another format etc. </p>\n\n\t<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\t<p>As I wrote in <a href=\"https://simonh.uk/2025/09/13/why-i-use-gnu-nano-as-my-default-editor/\">Why I use <span class=\"caps\">GNU</span> Nano</a> post, I don&#8217;t use Emacs as my text editor. But, I&#8217;ll probably start using it as my word processor instead&#8230;</p>\n\n\t<h2 class=\"footnotes\">Footnotes</h2>\n\n\t<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"fnd21a9a1cc29f4b53baae5f1d179ba3df-1\"><sup>1</sup> I&#8217;m trying to find an easy way to start Emacs in enriched mode.
